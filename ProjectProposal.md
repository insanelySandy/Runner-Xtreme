# Runner-Xtreme
Create a Geometry Dash parody but the obstacles are random each time you die.

**Project Proposal**

*Description:*

Taking the format of Geometry Dash, the player will go through obstacles they woul have to jump over, and they will go through these obstacles for has long as they can. The twist is that each time they die the obstacle course is randomize, so the player cannot memorize the course.

*Classes:*

The parent classes we will have in the game are the player, and the obstacles. However obstacles has child classes of the different obstacles that could be randomize.


*Libraries/Codes to Use:*

-random library

-Use the tetris blocks as the obstacle courses

-Use the mouse-detecting code from the Pygame tutorial to detect when the player clicks on the screen to click.
